This file explains how to start either the midterm or final proficiency exam
for cs162, cs260, or cs261.

These instructions will only work if the particular exam is currently
available. Please see D2L for the exam schedule.

Taking the exam requires the ability to use basic linux commands, a text
editor, and the g++ command line compiler. The following steps assume that you
have that knowledge. The steps also assume that you know how to use the
"turnin" command.

You should read all of the steps before beginning any of them. If you have any
questions about the steps or the exam ask the question BEFORE you start. Once
you have started the exam you are on a strict 1 hour time limit and I can only
answer limited questions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the the examples in the following steps use "cs999" for your class and
"midterm" for your exam. You should use your actual class (cs162, cs260, or
cs261) and your actual exam (midterm, final).

Step 1: Create a directory for your exam files.  

  example: mkdir cs999_midterm

Step 2: Enter the directory made in step 1.

  example: cd cs999_midterm

Step 3: Run ~mike.noel/bin/gef <course> <exam> <dir>. 

  example: ~mike.noel/bin/gef cs999 midterm .

When you run step 3, the gef program will ask you to acknowledge that you will
follow the exam rules. After you enter 'yes', the gef program will download
the selected exam files into the directory you specified ("." in the above
example). If you didn't enter 'yes' or if an error happened during Step 3, you
will not be able to do the following steps.

Step 4: Use tar to extract the exam files.

  example: tar xvf midterm_files.tar

Step 5: You are now doing the test. Read and follow the instructions in
instructions.txt.

Step 6: When you are done, use the turnin command to submit your results.
